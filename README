This data constitutes the entire HadISD dataset available here:
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisd/download.html

The data totals about 100gb of nc files unpacked. i suspect we 
could convert them to nc4 files and save some space. 

The data is a single nc file for each weather station, containing 
a number of variables and whatnot for each station. The lat/lon of 
the station is embedded as a global parameter in the file.
